Phone Number Pedia app 

You can demo this app through this [link](https://phone-number-pedia.vercel.app/)

Phone Number Pedia allows users to:
- Add contact
- Add multiple number on each contact
- Edit and delete existing contact
- Save their favorite contacts
- Search any contacts


Here is what framework stack I implemented on top of Phone Number Pedia app:
1. Next JS (React JS framework)
2. UI: CSS In JS (Emotion)
3. State management: Apollo GraphQL
4. Tesing: Jest (runner) and React Testing Library (DOM testing)
5. form validation: React hook form


If you want to reproduce this app from your local end, you should copy this command:
```
yarn && yarn test && yarn dev
```
